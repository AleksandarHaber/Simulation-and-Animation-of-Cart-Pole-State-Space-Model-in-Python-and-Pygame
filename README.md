# Simulation-and-Animation-of-Cart-Pole-State-Space-Model-in-Python-and-Pygame
In this GitHub repository, we posted Python scripts that are used to

(1) Automatically derive a symbolic state-space model of a cart-pole mechanical system.
(2) Simulate the derived state-space model in Python.
(3) Generate the animation of simulated state-space trajectories by using Pygame library.
